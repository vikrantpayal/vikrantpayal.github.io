Through the two decades of my work experience, these values have helped me the most. I live by them and encourage my teams to adopt them.

* Exhibit a sense of urgency. Be responsive. Deliver with speed (speed first, perfection second).
* Solve problems. Always be clear on what problem you are solving for the company.
* Create real value for the end customer. The value generated should be proportionate to or greater than the cost of generating the value.
* Work as a team. Do not silo work/knowledge/communications. Pitch in without hesitation. Share widely.
* Results matter more than effort. Avoid the complicated approaches and solutions as best as possible. Deliver quick results instead. Reuse, don't reinvent.
* Communicate frequently and effectively. Overcommunication is okay, under-communication is not.
* Respect everyone in the team. Conflicts, difference of opinions, arguments are okay. Communicate with civility and genuine respect.
* Learn constantly. Focus on applied learning (not just certificates).
* Aim high, deliver consistently.
* Work towards a clear personal growth plan.
* Take pride in everything you do. Our work should have our signature on it. Make it reflect quality, depth of thought, engineering excellence and user delight.
